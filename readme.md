# Filesystem Access Redirection Layer

Experimental library for redirecting filesystem access in a somewhat configurable manner. The main motivation behind this learning project is to find a way to make programs see files in certain paths without having to actually copy, move or symlink those files into the intended paths.

The library is written in C and compiles with C11 using Clang 13. There is a makefile available for building the project.
